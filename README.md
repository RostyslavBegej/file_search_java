# File Search (Java)

## Overview

File Search Java is a simple Java application designed to search for files within a specified directory based on a given file name or pattern. This tool is useful for quickly locating files in a directory structure without manually browsing through folders.

## Features

- **Recursive Search**: The application can search through directories and their subdirectories to find matching files.
- **Case-Insensitive Search**: The search is case-insensitive, making it easier to find files without worrying about exact case matching.
- **Pattern Matching**: Supports basic pattern matching using wildcards (e.g., `.txt`).

## Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have JDK 8 or later installed on your system.
- **Maven**: The project uses Maven for dependency management and building.
